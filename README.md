📍 The Process

This project was created as an **introductory exercise** to connect a chatbot to a web page.
The focus was on understanding:

* How to use webhooks to connect frontend and backend workflows
* Setting up n8n workflows to process user messages
* Interfacing with the ChatGPT API to generate AI responses
* Displaying the chatbot on a simple HTML/CSS page

This is a beginner-level prototype to explore AI integration in web projects without complex backend coding.

🚦 Running the Project

1. Deploy the n8n workflow and obtain the webhook URL
2. Add the webhook URL to the frontend JavaScript code
3. Open the HTML page in a browser
4. Start interacting with the chatbot — responses are generated via ChatGPT API
